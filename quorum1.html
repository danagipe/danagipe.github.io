	<h1>The Cost of "Ethical" Warfare</h1>

	<p>It is impossible to overstate the threat that the Swarm poses to our way of life and indeed our very existence. For those who have been following the disastrous saga that is the defense of Ilemchuuva, it is all too apparent that the Knights of Golarion are woefully unprepared to confront such a ruthless and single-minded adversary. And the cause is obvious. The Knights alone are burdened by righteous convictions: the protection of the weak, the minimization of casualties, the avoidance of collateral damage. Their enemy holds no such compunctions.</p>
	<p>Given these dire circumstances, this columnist is forced to ask: how long will we continue to cling to these naive ideals at our own peril? Will we, at the behest of Lin Camulan and the rest of the out-of-touch old guard of the Stewards, whose tactics are derived from the Silent War with the honorbound Veskarium, simply roll out the red carpet for this all-consuming hivemind? When the Swarm finally arrives in the Pact Worlds, strengthened and bolstered by all the near-space worlds it has subsumed, will it make any difference that we fought them with high-minded principles? That we fought fair?</p>
	<p>Dear reader, it is my sincere hope that every free-thinking and patriotic citizen of the Pact Worlds should answer to the above, resoundingly and with conviction: No! Of course not!</p>
	<p>But what is to be done?</p>
	<p>The solution, as ever, lies in the vaunted and storied histories of Old Golarion. For whenever our mythic homeworld was threatened by true calamity, whether it be demonic incursion, magical plague, or even the ferocious might of a mad god, it was not the Knights of Golarian&mdash;despite what the Church of Iomedae would have you believe&mdash;who formed the final line of defense for the huddled masses. No, when the Knights buckled under the weight of their own dogmatic restrictions, it was the Hellknights who did what needed to be done, and staved off our ultimate destruction.</p>
	<p>It is understandable that you might recoil from such a suggestion, for the Church of Iomedae has devoted entire cathedralships to the garbling of the pre-gap histories that are the Hellknights’ legacy, denigrating and literally demonizing these misunderstood heroes in a largely successful attempt to divert defense funding into their own already weighty coffers. Due to such efforts, the Hellknights were abolished in 18 AG by a short-sighted amendment to the same legislation that exiled the Corpse Fleet, legally equating the two paramilitary organizations. But whereas the latter is a loose collection of barrowships united by their hateful undead supremacy and engaging in what amounts to petty piracy, the former is a proud and historied organization dedicated to the imposition of order and civilization over the forces of wanton chaos that would threaten to destroy the world as we know it.</p>
	<p>Despite these targeted attacks, the Hellknights are still active in the Vast, keeping threats at bay which otherwise might have grown to threaten us as the Swarm does now. Need I provide more evidence of their true nature? Even without recognition, even as many curse their name and deny their contributions, they continue to render their selfless service to the ungrateful Pact Worlds. Thus do I have no doubt that if their disastrous abolition were lifted, and they were once again properly funded and folded into the official Pact Worlds military structure, they would flourish into exactly the fighting force which is needed at this moment to combat the sort of uncaring enemy we have not faced for millenia. For though their methods may be controversial or even distasteful to some, their effectiveness cannot be denied.</p>
	<p>So I call upon you, dear reader, to contact your Council Representative, and demand the repeal of the abolition of the Hellknights. It may very well mean the difference between our continued prosperity and our complete and utter destruction.</p>
