	<p>It should come as no surprise to readers of this column that the Knights of Golarion failed in their mission to drive away the Swarm threatening Ilemchuuva. I must nevertheless admit that even I did not predict such a precipitous and disastrous pratfall as what I have taken to calling the Lymikin Blunder. One must give credit to the Knight-General: the levels of incompetence on display within her organization would be inspirational were they not so troubling. Children and hatchlings across the Pact Worlds, saturated as they are in holovid propaganda such as “Halaina’s Heroes” and thus obsessed with becoming paladins when they grow up, can now be said to possess already the necessary qualities to stand as peers to those vaunted paragons. To wit: a naivete bordering on ignorance and a dearth of any skills actually pertaining to warfare. Indeed, a child playing paladins and demons, armored in gleaming AbMart-brand costume, has easily and at a fraction of the price done as much for the defense of Ilemchuuva as did Sharplance and his lackluster legion!</p>
	<p>Though I do not relish in mocking the dead, I find it necessary in this instance to drive home my point. Dear readers, it is high time that we, by which I mean our representatives in the Pact Council, remove our blinders. This is not a holovid cartoon. This is real life, and the consequences for failure are dire.</p>
	<p>That is all well and good, I hear you say, but what is your prescription? At the risk of vainglory, allow me first to direct the inquisitive reader to my previous piece, <a href="https://danagipe.github.io/quorum1.html">The Cost of “Ethical” Warfare</a>, which in light of recent events has proven grimly prescient. In it, I argue that an unfeeling threat such as the Swarm can only be confronted by a similarly steeled and guarded force, namely the Hellknights. But while I feel this advice is still relevant, it is unfortunately no longer sufficient, for new information has since come to light.</p>
	<p>I speak of course of the truly disturbing revelation that the Knights of Golarion have been infiltrated by turncoats and spies. Thank Iomedae that those brave whistleblowers realized their vows were to truth and justice and not to Halaina Lymikin, for it seems the Knight-General was striving to bury the report in hopes of saving what is already a very tarnished face (or worse, to cover her own tracks). My point, dear reader, is that these so-called paragons of light have demonstrated that they can no longer be trusted.</p>
	<p>For too long these antiquated crusaders have been allowed to operate their paramilitary farce with impunity, outside the jurisdiction of our duly elected Pact Council. Were I sitting in the Plenara, I would be screaming for nothing less than a top-to-bottom investigation of the Knights; a veritable inquisition, to use their own terminology. Those who do not cooperate should be labeled as traitors. After all, what have they to hide but their own treachery?</p>
	<p>Dear reader, let us heed the lesson that the colonists of Ilemchuuva, may their souls find Pharasma, paid so dearly to teach us. We are under attack, and the Knights of Golarion are a confirmed avenue of intrusion! The very future of our system is at stake! To do nothing in response to this threat is to concede the battle before it has even begun. Do not let our limp-wristed representatives sit on their hands, uttering blathering equivocations and refusing to take decisive action. Let your voice be heard! Tell them now: down with Lying Lymikin! Let rise the Hellknights!</p>
