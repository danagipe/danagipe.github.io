	<h1>Shipwrecked In The Vast With Doctor Redrix (Chapter 2)</h1>

	<br>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I wake up and the first thing I know is that someone is kissing me! I look up and Doctor Redrix is the one who is kissing me. He smiles and says “Good your awake. I had to do mouth-to-mouth or else you would of died. I’m sorry I couldn’t save your classmates. They’re all dead.”<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I start crying because I’m sad about my classmates being dead. I’m especialy sad about Brado and Trxmlx. I’m even sad about Bianca for a little bit but then I remember how mean she was to me and then I’m not sad anymore. I try to stand up but when I try to stand up my leg hurts alot and I say “Aaahhh!” Doctor Redrix catches me as I fall and puts me down gently to the grond. “Your leg is broken.” He says. “I will make you a cast for it.”<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Thank you.” I say.<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“What is your name” he says.<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I’m Genn” I say.<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“A pretty name for a pretty girl” he says.<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I look around while Doctor Redrix makes a cast for my leg. There are pieces of our broken ship all around. Luckly it looks like my suitcase with all my cute clothes landed really close by. We are in some kind of jungle planet and there are big purple trees all around. There is also some big yellow fruits on the trees that look really yummy.<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“OK your cast is done now, but you should get some rest. I will go and get-” Doctor Redrix says, but then a big alien monster jumps out of the tree and attacks him! It has blue fur and six arms and big orange eyes on tentacles. It grabs Doctor redrix with its big sharp claws and starts ripping his shirt off! Doctor Redrix is bleeding all over with no shirt on. Then there is a loud screech and Nelson flies out of the jungle and grabs the alien and pulls it off Doctor Redrix and then shocks it! Nelson lets the alien go and it is dead. But Doctor Redrix is lying on the ground really hurt.<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Genn I need your help.” Doctor Redrix says. “It is going to hurt your leg alot, but you will have to crawl over here and use my medkit to heal me.”<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It really did hurt my leg alot, but I knew I had to do it to save Doctor Redrix. I crawled to him and got his medkit. He told me which needle to use and I gave him a shot. After a minute he stopped bleeding. He held my hand and told me “That was amazing Genn. You saved my life. Now we will have to live together on this planet until someone comes to rescue us.”<br><br><br>
